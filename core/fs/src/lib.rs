//! File system change detection for a synced folder.
//!
//! A [`Snapshot`] records every file and folder under a root with its identity
//! (device, inode, birth time), size, modification time and executable bit.
//! [`Snapshot::rescan`] compares parts of the disk against it and reports typed
//! [`Change`]s, pairing a disappeared path with an appeared one of the same
//! identity as a rename. Watchers only decide which parts to rescan:
//!
//! - [`NativeWatcher`] listens to FSEvents on macOS and inotify on Linux and
//!   rescans the paths they name.
//! - [`RescanWatcher`] rescans the whole tree on an interval, for file systems
//!   where native events are unavailable or unreliable.
//!
//! Both start from a snapshot the caller kept from the previous run, and their
//! first poll rescans the whole tree, so changes made while nothing was
//! watching are reported like any other.
//!
//! Scans never trust a path spelling or follow a link. They walk the tree
//! through directory handles opened without following symbolic links, take
//! names from directory listings rather than from event paths, and check that
//! each directory they enter is the one they listed. A scan that sees its root
//! disappear or a directory change under it publishes nothing.
//!
//! A scanner in userspace cannot take an atomic snapshot of a tree that keeps
//! changing, so scans are eventually consistent: once the tree is quiet, a
//! rescan reports it exactly. While it changes, a removal is confirmed rather
//! than inferred. A path the scan saw disappear, as a removal or as the source
//! of a rename, is published only if, at its confirmation, its parent folder,
//! reached from the root without following links, does not list that exact
//! name holding an entry of the old kind. A final pass then opens each such
//! parent again from a fresh root handle and requires every folder on the way
//! to keep its identity, and the parent its modification time and listing. A
//! path that is present, cannot be read, or whose parent changed in between
//! keeps its old entry and is returned for another rescan.
//!
//! A confirmation is a point in time, and these windows remain:
//!
//! - Siblings are confirmed against one listing of their parent, and the final
//!   pass looks at the parent once more. A change undone between the two, such
//!   as a folder swapped out and back or a name created and removed again, is
//!   not seen; neither is one the parent's listing and modification time do
//!   not show.
//! - After the final pass, a removed path can reappear before the caller acts
//!   on the change. Recovering from that is the caller's job: the sync engine's
//!   mass-delete guard and the server trash.
//! - Replacing a file with a folder, or a folder with a file, is reported as
//!   the old entry removed and the new one created at the same path.
//!
//! Scans and watchers given [`Rules`] also leave out what the rules name
//! (design §5.10): the built-in platform files, and every entry a `.fbignore`
//! file or the device's own list excludes, with everything below it. A scan
//! reads the [`RULES_FILE`] of each folder it lists and hands the bytes to
//! the caller's matcher ([`Ignore`]) before it judges the folder's entries.
//! Being left out is never a removal. An entry a changed rule leaves out
//! leaves the snapshot without a change, and one a changed rule includes
//! again is reported as created. An entry that disappeared is looked for by
//! identity at and below the entries a rule leaves out, with listings and
//! stats only. Found there, it was moved and nothing was deleted, so it is
//! reported as [`Change::Ignored`]. A miss is reported as a removal, although
//! a file saved again after such a move has a new identity and is missed.
//! Design §5.10 holds a miss for a question to the user while any entry is
//! left out, and the engine cannot ask that question yet. The search does not
//! look in [`PRIVATE_DIR`] or in the built-in platform files.
//!
//! The engine's private folder [`PRIVATE_DIR`] at the root is never scanned.
//! The [`check_root`] of design §6.2, the root [`Marker`] and the rename that
//! never replaces its target ([`rename_no_replace`], [`probe_no_replace`])
//! live next to the scans.
//!
//! Effects change the disk through a [`Space`]: a descriptor of the root from
//! which every [`Location`] is resolved one folder at a time, without following
//! links and checking each folder's identity, and resolved again before each
//! rename ([`Space::recheck`]). The caller binds the space to a descriptor it
//! already holds ([`Space::bind`]), and the space changes nothing once the path
//! the root was linked at names another folder or nothing ([`Space::held`]).
//! Displaced entries go to the local trash ([`Space::trash`]), which
//! [`Space::reclaim_trash`] empties by age and size, turning an entry written
//! to after it entered into a recovered file ([`recovered_name`]).
//!
//! [`Space::apply`] carries out one [`Effect`] with the quarantine protocol of
//! design §5.2, writing the root marker first and calling a hook at every
//! [`Step`], and [`Space::recover`] finishes or undoes the effect in flight
//! after a crash (design §5.3).
//!
//! Symbolic links and special files are not synced in v0 (spec §5.1) and are
//! skipped.
