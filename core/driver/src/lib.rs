//! The sync driver: everything around the engine that a client runs on one device (docs/design/driver.md).
//!
//! - [`Paths`], [`Credential`] and [`Config`]: where a profile keeps its files, the device credential (one file only
//!   its owner can read, outside every linked folder) and the device-local configuration with its `[sync]` rules.
//! - [`Driver`]: the profile's API, shared by the Linux daemon and, through `core/ffi`, the macOS app. It pairs the
//!   device, links and unlinks folders, reports [`Status`], lists [`Question`]s and records answers, records the
//!   restores a person asks for ([`RestoreRequest`]), and runs one task per linked folder.
//! - Each folder task checks the root (design §6.2) and claims the folder, observes the disk through an [`Observer`],
//!   and keeps a `core/net` session with the space. It runs the sync engine between them: the server's log goes
//!   into the remote tree in `core/store`, observations go into the local tree, the engine's effects are applied to
//!   the folder, and its commits are sent to the server.
//! - [`policy`]: what to do after the server refuses a call (H1 of reports/BOX-71).
//! - [`update`]: whether a newer Koidrive release is out, asked of GitHub at most once a day.
//! - [`ignore`]: the ignore rules of a folder, in the forms the scans and the engine take them.
//!
//! New files and folders sync in both directions. Edits, renames, deletes and conflicts go through the same loop and
//! are not proved end to end yet. docs/design/driver.md describes the loop and lists what is still to wire.
