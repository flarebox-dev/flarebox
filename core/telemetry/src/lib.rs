//! Opt-in usage reports (docs/guide/telemetry.md). Code that records something calls a [`Recorder`] with one of the
//! closed types in [`schema`]: enums, counts and durations. No recording call takes text, so a path, a name or an
//! error message has no field to travel in. The recorder sums what it is given per UTC hour in memory and keeps events with the second they happened. [`Store`]
//! keeps it on disk under the profile's state directory until [`send`] posts it to PostHog's batch API, through
//! the project's own host.
