//! Network client for a Koidrive server, the client side of spec v0 and RFC 0001 to 0003. It does I/O only and has
//! no dependency on the sync engine: requests and events are `koidrive-proto` types, and a driver feeds them to the
//! engine and stores what must survive a restart (credentials, the stream position, the commit slot).
//!
//! - [`Api`] calls the HTTP endpoints of spec v0 section 15.1, and [`Auth`] keeps a device's access token fresh.
//! - [`Session`] is the WebSocket session with one space: RPCs, the change stream as [`Event`]s, `Reauth`, and
//!   reconnects with backoff that resend only what RFC 0002 section 2 allows.
//! - [`Transfer`] uploads and downloads chunks through the targets the server hands out, checking every chunk
//!   against its SHA-256.
//!
//! TLS is rustls with the platform verifier, for HTTP (through reqwest) and for the WebSocket alike.
