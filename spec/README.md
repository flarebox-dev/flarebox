# Koidrive spec

The protocol schema shared by the server (`server/`) and the Rust clients (`core/`), as Protocol Buffers under `proto/koidrive/v1/`. This is draft v0: field numbers and messages may still change until the first release.

Run `buf lint` and `buf generate` in this directory. Generation writes TypeScript to `server/src/gen/` and Rust to `core/proto/src/gen/`; both are checked in.

## The RFCs change spec v0

Spec v0 was drafted outside this repository, and the schema here is its current form. Each RFC in [`rfc/`](rfc/) fixes a rule that v0 leaves open or changes one it states. Read an RFC together with the RFCs it builds on. Where an RFC amends an earlier RFC, the earlier one already holds the change unless the table says otherwise. Engine terms such as R, S and L and "design §N" refer to the [sync-engine design](../docs/design/sync-engine/README.md).
