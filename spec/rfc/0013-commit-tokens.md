# RFC 0013: Commit tokens

Status: proposed. Applies to spec v0 (format_version 1). Amends spec v0 §7.3 and §7.5, and RFC 0002 §3.

A client tells the server where it stands in the log by a seq alone: `Resume.since_seq` and `Commit.base_seq`. A server that loses commits within one history, as after a storage loss, gives their seqs to later commits. Once other devices have brought the head back up to a device's `since_seq`, the server answers that device's `Resume` with the log after it, and the device's R silently forks from the server: it keeps the lost commits and never receives the ones that took their seqs (GUN-423). A commit built on such a seq passes the base check, and R7 then treats every revision at or below `base_seq` as seen, so a resent `Delete` can trash a node another device moved in at a reused seq (GUN-454).

This RFC names the commit a client stands at by its token as well as its seq. A bare section number such as §2 refers to this RFC; sections of spec v0 are written as spec v0 §N.

## 1. Tokens

The **commit token** at a seq is the pair (`commit_id`, `committed_at_ms`) of the commit the server applied there. Both are in every `CommitRecord`. The token at seq 0 is empty: `commit_id` is the empty string and `committed_at_ms` is 0.

A token names one application of a commit, not only the commit. A commit in flight that the server applied, then lost, then applied again after the resend (RFC 0002 §2, *w* = *a*) gets a new `committed_at_ms`, so its token differs, unless the server's clock gives the same millisecond.

A restore brings back a prefix of the log. If the server holds, at a seq, the application a client saw there, it holds everything before it, so one token is enough.

## 2. Messages

New fields only:

- `Resume`: `since_commit_id = 3`, `since_committed_at_ms = 4`, the token at `since_seq`.
- `Commit`: `base_commit_id = 9`, `base_committed_at_ms = 10`, the token at `base_seq`.
- `CaughtUp`: `head_commit_id = 2`, `head_committed_at_ms = 3`, the token at `head_seq`.
- `TreePage`: `head_commit_id = 4`, `head_committed_at_ms = 5`, the token at `head_seq`.
- `CommitResult`: `committed_at_ms = 4`, the commit's own time, also in a stored result. With the client's `commit_id` it is the token at `seq`.

## 3. The check

A token claims nothing when its `commit_id` is empty or its seq is 0. Otherwise the server reads its commit at that seq, and the token holds when that commit's token is equal. A seq the log holds no commit for never holds a token.

- `Resume`: the check runs after the history fence, `since_seq` above the head and `since_seq` below the floor (spec v0 §7.3). A token that does not hold is answered with `ResyncRequired`, reason `AHEAD_OF_SERVER`.
- `Commit`: the check is part of RFC 0002 §3 step 4, after `base_seq` above the head and before `require_head`. A token that does not hold is refused with `AHEAD_OF_SERVER`, and nothing is applied. The stored result for the `commit_id` (step 2) comes first, so a resend of a commit the server holds gets its stored result.

`AHEAD_OF_SERVER` already means that the server lost commits this client applied. The client lists the tree and the trash again (spec v0 §7.5) and sends again what was lost.

## 4. Truncation

`log_floor_seq` is the oldest seq a `Resume` can start after, so the token at the floor stays checkable. A server that truncates its log keeps the floor commit's token, written in the same transaction that moves `log_floor_seq`, and checks a `Resume` or a `Commit` at the floor against it. A `Resume` below the floor gets `LOG_TRUNCATED` before the token check. The server does not truncate yet; the sim does, and keeps the floor token.

## 5. Clients

The client keeps the token at its cursor and always pairs it with the seq it names. A token paired with another seq makes every `Resume` fail the check, and the client would list the tree forever. The client learns the token:

- from each record it applies, as its cursor moves to that record's seq;
- from the result of its own commit, with that commit's `commit_id`, only when the cursor moves to the result's seq;
- from the first `TreePage` of a listing, whose `head_seq` the following `Resume` starts from, and from each record replayed onto the listing;
- from a `CaughtUp` whose `head_seq` equals the cursor's seq, when the cursor holds no token, as one stored before this RFC.

A commit names the token at its `base_seq` when it is built, and a resend keeps it.

## 6. Mixed versions

An empty token claims nothing in either direction, so no `Welcome` feature announces this RFC.

- An old client sends no token, and the server skips both checks.
- A new client of an old server learns tokens from records only, and nothing checks them.
- A client upgraded from a store without tokens resumes with an empty token until it applies a record or catches up at its cursor's seq.

## 7. Cost

Each `Resume` and `Commit` adds one read of the server's commit at a seq by its primary key, and about 46 bytes: a 36-character ID and a time. `CaughtUp`, `TreePage` and `CommitResult` add the same. When the check fires, the client lists the tree once, as for any `AHEAD_OF_SERVER`.

A re-application that the server gives the same `committed_at_ms` passes the check. That needs a lost response, a loss and a restart within one millisecond, and is accepted.
